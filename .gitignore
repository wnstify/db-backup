# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SAFE NOTES:
# - `.env` secrets stay ignored; `.env.example` is tracked.
# - Lockfiles are ignored here; delete those lines if you prefer committing them.
# - WordPress uploads are ignored (big/binary content shouldnâ€™t be in Git).
# - wp-config.php is ignored (contains DB creds). Use wp-config-sample.php instead.
