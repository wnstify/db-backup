Features
--------

*   Dumps each non-system database to compressed `.sql.gz` files
*   Creates timestamped backup folders
*   Packs all database dumps into a single tar.gz archive
*   Configurable retention policy (auto-delete old backups)
*   Safe authentication using external config file
*   Intelligent compression (uses pigz for multi-threaded compression if available)
*   Comprehensive logging
*   Lock mechanism to prevent concurrent runs 

Requirements
------------

*   Bash shell
*   MySQL/MariaDB client tools
*   gzip (or pigz for faster compression)

Installation
------------

1.  Download the script:
    
        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wnstify/db-backup/refs/heads/main/db_backup.sh
        chmod +x db_backup.sh
    
2.  (Optional) Create a credentials file to avoid password prompts:
    
        echo -e "[client]\nuser=root\npassword=YOUR_PASSWORD" > .db.cnf
        chmod 600 .db.cnf
    

Usage
-----

Simply run the script:

    ./mysql_backup.sh

Or set up a cron job for automated backups:

    # Run daily at 2:30 AM
    30 2 * * * /path/to/mysql_backup.sh

Configuration
-------------

Edit these variables at the top of the script:

    LOCAL_BACKUP_DIR="${PWD}/db_backups"   # where backups are stored
    KEEP_DAYS=14                           # retention period (0 = keep forever)
    REMOVE_FOLDER_AFTER_ARCHIVE=true       # remove individual dumps after archiving

How It Works
------------

1.  Creates a timestamped directory for the current backup
2.  Connects to MySQL/MariaDB and gets a list of non-system databases
3.  Dumps each database with optimal settings for reliable restores
4.  Compresses each dump with gzip/pigz
5.  Archives all dumps into a single tar.gz file
6.  Cleans up old backups according to retention policy
7.  Logs all operations
